# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo holds implementations of data structures and algorithms talked about
in the Data Structures and Algorithms lecture at FHJ.

## Algorithms

- Factorial
  - iterate
  - recursive
- Sum odd numbers

### Max subarray sum

Find the subarray with the biggest sum in an array.

- Brute force algorithm
- Divide and conquer algorithm
- Scanline algorithm

### Bracecheck

Check if opening and closing braces match.

- using self implemented stack data structure

### Sorting

- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort
- Quick sort
  - in-situ
- Merge sort
    - 2-Way merge sort algorithm

### Hashing

Various ways to implement hashmap functionality.

- Linear Open Addressing
- Quadratic Open Addressing
- Brent's Algorithm
- Own implementation of recursive Brent's Algorithm

## Data Structures

### Linked List

Simple linked list.

- implemented in C
